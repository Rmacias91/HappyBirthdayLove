An Android Application made for my girlfriend's birthday. Has pictures and captions of our time together. I even put the "Can't take
my eyes off of you" By Frankie Valli and the 4 seasons. Just used a Page Viewer/Page Adapter with fragments. I used a service with binding
to keep the music playing in the background. Images and music is stored locally, which probably wasn't the best idea since my girlfriend
has no space on her phone. The app takes about 20mb. I wanted the ability to use the app whenever she wanted though, so I stored everything
in the app.
